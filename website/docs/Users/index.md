# Users

Welcome to OpenCatalogi! This documentation will help you get started with using the platform as a regular user. If you're looking for technical documentation, please check out our [Developer Guide](/docs/Developers) or [Administrator Guide](/docs/Administrator).

## Core Concepts

The core building block of OpenCatalogi is the Publication, which is based on the DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary) standard. A publication can be thought of as a digital dossier or case file that contains:

- Metadata describing the publication 
- Optional files and documents that are being published
- Links to related publications or external resources

Publications live within Catalogs, which are collections of related publications. A catalog might represent an organization, department, or topic area.
